<h3>Big daddy<br/>
  -1999</h3>
<p>
  June 24, 1999 One of the most funniest movies to exist till this 
  day hit the movie theater. If you are looking for laughing and love, 
  beleile me this is tyour movie. Starting Adam sandler, who taked this 
  role and runs with it. Great cast, great detail, and lots of laughter.<br/> 
  Will I watch again?<br/>
  Yes, I will and yes i have. LOL

<h3>
The Hateful Eight<br/>
-2015
</h3>

<p>
The Hateful Eight has everything I needed in a movie. Western, Suspense, Laugther and lots action. Tarantino's throws alot at you in this film, so keep up. It is a long movie but you will not even notice because just that good. Pack with Great Actors like Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Sam Jackson & Jennifer Jason Leigh. As they would say in music, "they didn't miss a note." Job well done! <br/>
Will I watch again?<br/>
Most definnietly, I will. This is a Fave in my book.

  movie. They way all the events came togehter was magiacal.<br>
  Will I watch again?<br/>
